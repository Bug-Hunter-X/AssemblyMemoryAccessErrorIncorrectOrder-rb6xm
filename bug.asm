mov eax, [ebx+esi*4+0x10]

The above instruction is an example of an uncommon error that can occur in assembly language programming.  This instruction attempts to access memory using an address calculation involving the EBX, ESI, and a displacement.  However, the displacement (0x10) is added *after* the multiplication with ESI.  This order of operations can be easily overlooked and lead to incorrect memory access.  The intended behavior might have been to add the displacement before multiplying by ESI.  This would change the address calculation significantly.

The error is subtle and unlikely to be detected by compilers or static analysis tools because it's perfectly valid assembly syntax, just potentially the wrong operation order.
